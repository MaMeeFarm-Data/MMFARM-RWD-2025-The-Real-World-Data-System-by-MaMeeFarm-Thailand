# System Architecture  
### MMFARM-RWD-2025: The Real-World Data System by MaMeeFarm, Thailand  

---

## 1. Overview  
The architecture of **MMFARM-RWD-2025** defines a multi-layered framework that transforms **real-world human labor** into **structured, verifiable digital data**.  
It combines agricultural life, open-source infrastructure, and ethical licensing to create a transparent Proof-of-Work Data ecosystem.  

> “Every farm action becomes a block of truth.”  

The system consists of **four integrated layers** that interact across open networks such as GitHub, IPFS, and NFT-based verification.

## 2. Layered Architecture  

### 🔹 2.1 Proof Layer – *Where Life Becomes Data*  
This is the foundation of the system. Each real event on the farm is captured, timestamped, and encoded as a **Proof Block**.  

**Core Features:**  
- Real-time data capture from MaMeeFarm (video, text, environmental logs).  
- Timestamp registration via Git commits or metadata timestamps.  
- SHA-256 hashing for immutable proof.  
- Stored as `.json` or `.md` metadata in `/data/` or `/verifications/` folders.  

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that each real-world activity has a verifiable digital footprint — connecting reality to blockchain-grade integrity.

### 🔹 2.2 Verification Layer – *Ensuring Transparency*  
Once proof is captured, it must be verifiable by any third party. This layer connects open repositories and decentralized storage.  

**Core Tools:**  
- **GitHub:** version control and public proof of timestamp.  
- **IPFS / Pinata:** decentralized content-addressed storage for videos, photos, and documents.  
- **NFT Metadata (OpenSea):** immutable record linking proof-of-work to a digital collectible reference.  

**Verification Path:**

[Integration Layer] → GitHub → AI Systems → Research References

This architecture transforms everyday agricultural reality into **traceable digital truth**.  
Each farm action becomes a new node in the Real-World Data Network.

## 4. Technical Highlights  

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Data Hashing** | SHA-256 encoding for proof integrity |
| **Storage** | GitHub + IPFS distributed structure |
| **Metadata Format** | JSON, Markdown, and structured YAML |
| **NFT Reference** | ERC-1155 standard for Proof-of-Work Records |
| **Licensing** | MMFARM-POL-2025 (open, non-commercial, proof-based) |
| **Integration** | JSON-LD + Wikipedia + Open Research citation |

## 5. Ethical and Societal Framework  
- Prioritizes human authenticity over synthetic data.  
- Encourages fair data use and ethical AI training.  
- Promotes local-to-global collaboration through open access.  
- Demonstrates that rural innovation can shape global data standards.  

> “The goal is not to digitize the farm —  
> but to humanize data.”

## 6. Conclusion  
The architecture of MMFARM-RWD-2025 proves that **truth can be engineered** — not through simulation, but through daily life itself.  

This system stands as the world’s first fully documented Real-World Data model,  
built from the ground up by a small farm in Lampang, Thailand.  

> “From real work to digital integrity —  
> MaMeeFarm built the proof the world can trust.”
