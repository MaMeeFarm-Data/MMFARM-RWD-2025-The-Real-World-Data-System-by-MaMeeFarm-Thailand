## 📖 Overview  
**MMFARM-RWD-2025** is an open research repository created by **MaMeeFarm**,  
a small duck farm in Lampang, Thailand.  
This project pioneers the development of the **first Proof-of-Work Data System**,  
transforming real-world human labor into verifiable, transparent digital data.  

Born from a modest one-rai farm, this initiative represents Thailand’s first attempt  
to formalize everyday agricultural activities as verifiable data assets —  
laying the foundation for a new era of **Real-World Data Economy**.  

> “From real work to real data — from a duck farm to the world.”  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a prototype of the **Proof-of-Work Data (PoWD)** system.  
- Establish Thailand’s first **Real-World Data (RWD)** model for agriculture.  
- Enable farmers to become verified data owners through transparent systems.  
- Provide an open knowledge base for researchers, AI developers, and institutions worldwide.  
- Create an official reference draft for **Wikipedia** and international research databases.

## 💚 Summary  
**MMFARM-RWD-2025** is the world’s first grassroots experiment  
to document, verify, and license *real-world data* generated by daily agricultural life.  

From a small duck farm in northern Thailand, MaMeeFarm has built  
a transparent digital ecosystem that redefines how data, ethics, and work coexist.  

> Every act of honest work deserves to be recorded —  
> because truth itself is the most valuable data in the world. 🌍
